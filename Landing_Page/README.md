I have just completed Level 1, Task 2 of my Web Development internship with CODSOFT!

This task involved creating a landing page, and it was an incredible experience to apply my HTML and CSS skills to design a visually appealing and user-friendly page.

This is just the beginning, and I'm looking forward to learning and growing even more in the field of web development. Huge thanks to CODSOFT for this amazing opportunity!
